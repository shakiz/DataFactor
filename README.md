This project can capture image and identify words from that captured image by using firebase ml kit model and other ml kit components.
I was trying to find a way to capture texts from an image and i ended up that android has their own machine learning library for 
android application.I followed the default documentation from android developers forum.
Though i am still trying to improve text recognization service from image.Because it is a tough task to do at first but day by day it will be 
much easier than today.


ML Kit comes with a set of ready-to-use APIs for common mobile use cases: recognizing text, detecting faces, identifying landmarks, scanning barcodes, labeling images, and identifying the language of text. Simply pass in data to the ML Kit library and it gives you the information you need.

ML Kit’s selection of APIs run on-device or in the cloud. Our on-device APIs can process your data quickly and work even when there’s no network connection. Our cloud-based APIs, on the other hand, leverage the power of Google Cloud Platform's machine learning technology to give you an even higher level of accuracy.
