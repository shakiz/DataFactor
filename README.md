This project can capture image and identify words from that captured image by using firebase ml kit model and other ml kit components.
I was trying to find a way to capture texts from an image and i ended up that android has their own machine learning library for 
android application.I followed the default documentation from android developers forum.
Though i am still trying to improve text recognization service from image.Because it is a tough task to do at first but day by day it will be 
much easier than today.
